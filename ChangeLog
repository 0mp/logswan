Logswan 1.06 (YYYY-MM-DD)

- Relicensed under the BSD 2-Clause license
- Use strtok_r instead of strtok to tokenize lines
- Do not attempt to increment countries and continents arrays if there
  is no GeoIP database loaded
- Harmonize variable names for the GeoIP databases
- GeoIP lookups are now disabled by default (add a -g switch to enable)
- Use fstat on open file descriptor instead of using stat before opening
  the input file
- Count the log line as invalid if parsedLine.remoteHost is NULL
- Initialize some uninitialized variables
- Headers cleanup



Logswan 1.05 (2016-02-25)

- Documentation update (notes on measuring Logswan memory usage)
- Add additional include directories for compat functions + dependencies
  to avoid using relative path in includes
- Check that *lineBuffer is not NUL before attempting to parse log line
- Perform GeoIP lookup and HLL add in the same if block
- Increment IPv4 and IPv6 hits counters individually and conditionally
- Use CMake to check if the system has OpenBSD's pledge available and
  link pledge conditionally using a null implementation when compiled
  on non OpenBSD systems
- Adding an array of months, for the upcoming split log functionalities



Logswan 1.04 (2016-01-10)

- Moving global variables into main
- Using 'size_t' instead of 'int' for array indexes in for loops
- Using 'uint32_t' for all non 'uint64_t' integers
- Do not increment hits and processed lines counter for each parsed line,
  compute total only once when everything is parsed
- Setting 'CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE' to 'Release' and formatting fixes
- Sanitize CMake script to build under NetBSD (Thanks Kamil Rytarowski)
- Initializing some uninitialized variables
- Renaming 'DATADIR' variables to 'GEOIPDIR'



Logswan 1.03 (2016-01-01)

- Remove header display and do not print name of processed file
- Print results to stderr instead of stdout
- Output JSON data to stdout instead of creating a new file
- Define GeoIP databases path in CMakeLists.txt
- Adding log file name in the JSON output
- Removing some hardcoded values and replacing them with constants
  defined in config.h
- Breaking the loop when a match is found in the request parser
- Using enumeration constants instead of macros
- Process GeoIP continent information
- Re-ordering protocols and methods with more common occurences on top of
  the list, allowing to break earlier when iterating through the array
- Adding support for reading logs from standard input
- Renaming 'definitions' files to 'config'
- Increasing countries array size, as an attempt to be future-proof
- Initial support for using pledge() on OpenBSD
- Documentation updates (HLL precision, Features list, GeoIP databases)
- Updated JSON output example
- Added a manual page



Logswan 1.02 (2015-11-02)

- Renaming 'resource' variable to 'request' in the 'logLine' struct
- Do not attempt to parse empty date tokens
